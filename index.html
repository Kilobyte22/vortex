        <p>Vortex is a scripting language that compiles to Lua. It aims to provide a comfortable, modern scripting language while retaining the simplicity of Lua and its ability to be embedded. The current version is implemented in Lua as well, however, I'm planning to self-host at some point.
It's however still very much a work in progress, far from complete.</p>

<h3>Convenient</h3>

<p>The language uses a curly braced syntax and is inspired by multiple well known languages, including Lua, Scheme, OCaml/F# or Rust.</p>

<h3>Multi-paradigm</h3>

<p>Vortex features the procedural, functional and object oriented programming paradigms. It inherits its featureset from Lua and adds some more. Unlike Lua, it's a fully expression based language. A short list of new features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Default function arguments</li>
<li>Implicit return values</li>
<li>Block expressions</li>
<li>Builtin coroutine/generator syntax</li>
<li>Pattern matching</li>
<li>Sequences</li>
<li>AST hygienic macros</li>
<li>Builtin object syntax</li>
<li>Destructuring let</li>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>Table slicing</li>
<li>Table joining</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul><h3>Batteries included</h3>

<p>Vortex aims to make programming comfortable. Comprehensive standard library is being designed and the language is stuffed with features.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>Vortex-generated code runs as fast as handwritten Lua and is compatible with Lua 5.2 and LuaJIT 2.</p>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<p>You can access any Lua library from Vortex. However, in order to prevent conflicts, Vortex stays in its own environment, accessing Lua through a separate namespace.</p>

<h3>Want more?</h3>

<p>Please refer to the documentation (hosted in the repository, in the docs/ directory) and wiki (hosted on GitHub).</p>
