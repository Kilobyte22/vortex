It aims to provide a comfortable, modern scripting language while retaining the simplicity of Lua and its ability to be embedded. The current version is implemented in Lua as well, however, I'm planning to self-host at some point.\r\nIt's however still very much a work in progress, far from complete.\r\n\r\n### Convenient\r\nThe language uses a curly braced syntax and is inspired by multiple well known languages, including Lua, Scheme, OCaml/F# or Rust.\r\n\r\n### Multi-paradigm\r\nVortex features the procedural, functional and object oriented programming paradigms. It inherits its featureset from Lua and adds some more. Unlike Lua, it's a fully expression based language. A short list of new features:\r\n\r\n* Default function arguments\r\n* Implicit return values\r\n* Block expressions\r\n* Builtin coroutine/generator syntax\r\n* Pattern matching\r\n* Sequences\r\n* AST hygienic macros\r\n* Builtin object syntax\r\n* Destructuring let\r\n* Lists\r\n* Table slicing\r\n* Table joining\r\n* and more\r\n\r\n### Batteries included\r\nVortex aims to make programming comfortable. Comprehensive standard library is being designed and the language is stuffed with features.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\nVortex-generated code runs as fast as handwritten Lua and is compatible with Lua 5.2 and LuaJIT 2.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\nYou can access any Lua library from Vortex. However, in order to prevent conflicts, Vortex stays in its own environment, accessing Lua through a separate namespace.\r\n\r\n### Want more?\r\nPlease refer to the documentation (hosted in the repository, in the docs/ directory) and wiki (hosted on GitHub).","google":"","name":"Vortex"}
